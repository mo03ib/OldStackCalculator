# OldStackCalculator
Stack based calculator from ANU course from 2005, based on Stack Version 1 from the lecture notes

The code for push and pop is quite tricky... well, not so much to read, since it looks quite straightforward, but to follow what's going on when it runs. Enjoy.

This is coded in a simple, stand-alone sort of way. No Stack interface. No generics. It would be a worthwhile exercise to take this approach and try to incorporate it into the framework of the other Stack project as a third implementation, adding to the existing ArrayStack and LinkedStack. Is that possible? How do they compare? ...

Use this code as the starting point for the ANU lab exercises on the stack based calculator. You should probably find those quite easy, but they will certainly be useful if you're struggling with this material.
